# We know that the themes don't fit the names

Welcome to TryEco. Here we (will) have a lot of projects, that have to do with configuring Windows and Linux. We also have a theme - `Try` -, which has these four sub-themes `Beaver` `Honeybee` `Ant` and `Turtle`.

We also have a [website](https://tryeco.github.io) (WIP)!
